Testing OPTIONS /v1/projects?recent=1:
Status: Unauthorized (401)
- ISSUE: Preflight requests are being handled by auth middleware instead of CORS middleware
- Expected: 200/204 with proper CORS headers

Testing OPTIONS /v1/director/veo-3-prompt:
Status: Unauthorized (401)  
- ISSUE: Same problem - auth middleware intercepts OPTIONS before CORS can handle
- Expected: 200/204 with Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Allow-Credentials, Allow-Headers

Testing GET /ping:
Status: 200
- OK: Basic endpoints work

ROOT CAUSE: CORS middleware is not intercepting OPTIONS requests early enough in the WSGI stack.
OPTIONS requests hit authentication middleware first, which returns 401 before CORS headers can be added.
