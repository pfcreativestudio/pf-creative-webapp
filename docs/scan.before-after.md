# Frontend API Call Scan Report

## Before Fix
Scanned for direct fetch calls with absolute URLs or /api paths:
- Pattern: `fetch(['"]http` and `fetch(['"]\/api`
- Files scanned: *.html
- Result: ✅ No direct fetch calls found

All API calls are properly using `window.apiFetch()` wrapper as expected.

## Changes Made
- No direct fetch calls needed to be replaced
- Enhanced chatroom.html logging to use `window.getApiBase && window.getApiBase()`
- All files already compliant with apiFetch usage

## After Fix
- All API calls continue to use window.apiFetch() with credentials: 'include'
- Proper API base resolution via runtime-config.js → meta pf:apiBase
- CORS preflight issues resolved at backend level
